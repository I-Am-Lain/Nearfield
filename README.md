The Nearfield Project
-------
This is a fully deployed website, accessible at https://nearfield.herokuapp.com/

Nearfield was a project built with Brandon Fonnemon and John Lovitsch. It utilizes data from NASA's NEO API, and models those points in a 3-dimensional space using Three.js.

Displayed are ~15,000 points, each representing either an Active Satellite, Inactive Satellite, or 'space debris'.

Users can click on each satellite in the left-hand window to highlight the point in space that it's located at.
Users can also scroll/zoom-in/zoom-out with the 3d-model for better viewing.
